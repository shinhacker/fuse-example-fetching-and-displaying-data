# Fetching and Displaying Data Example
Example project to accompany the "[Fetching and Displaying Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m53gIB35AC8)" Fuse tutorial video. This is a super basic example, and uses the [JSONPlaceholder fake online REST API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) (and in particular, the [photos route](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)) to grab a bunch of picture data and display them using a FuseJS Observable and data binding. All relevant code is in the `MainView.ux` file.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.8.3. It was later updated to be compatible with Fuse 0.20 and onwards.

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
